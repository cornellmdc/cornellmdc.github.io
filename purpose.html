                    <p>Medium was founded in 2015 by 3 AAP students who decided to transform a design publication into a
                        live event.
                        Together, they created RAW EXPO, a design exhibition in which students from all across campus
                        showcased their work.
                        The event was a huge hit - 500+ attendees proved that there was an incredible amount of interest
                        and need for an interdisciplinary design group.
                        From RAW, Medium Design Collective spawned, to become a community of designers who collaborate
                        on innovative projects
                        and serve as a platform and resource for design dialogue.</p>

                    <p>As individuals in the early 21st century, we exist in a time of unprecedented transformation. An
                        era that bore witness to tectonic cultural shifts, colossal technological innovations, and
                        revolutionary social movements. But as designers, we hold a particular responsibility-- to
                        create, reimagine, and record through our hands, eyes, and minds the milieu of our time.</p>
                    <p>As we spend more time plugged in, more and more questions, both ethical and philosophical arise
                        as to the effects of such a way of living. What is a painting when it's in pixels? What is
                        precious when everything can be replicated? What is authentic when we can change who we are?</p>
